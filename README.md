8. environment.au3 - This is what I run when I get a new PC, so I will have all the registry keys and folders I need for my workflow.

9. get_putty_sessions.au3 - This script will get all your PuTTY sessions stored in the registry and output them to a text file.  This to me is handy, if I need to make changes to any of the session config, I always use this to get a full list, so I can tick off the servers once I have made the change.
